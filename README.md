# StockPriceHeatmap
Python script which creates a heatmap plotting strike price vs stock price from a dataset consisting of previous calls. Uses dataset with columns for "Strike Price", "Stock Price", "Buy Price", "Sell Price", "Date", "Volatility", "Market Condition" and "Ticker/Stock Symbol". The colour of each point on the heatmap represents the PnL for that trade.
